# **RBAC APP**

> **This project is being developed for demostrating the implementation of authentication system using JWT.**

---

## **🚀 About the Project**

This project is a User Management System designed to streamline user operations such as registration, authentication, and role-based access management. It provides different levels of access based on user roles, ensuring a secure and tailored experience for each user type.

Administrators can manage all users, including viewing, updating, and deleting user profiles.

Moderators have the ability to view all users but cannot modify or delete their data.

Users are restricted to reading and updating only their own data, ensuring privacy and control over personal information.
The system offers a seamless interface for all users, with conditional rendering and role-based functionalities tailored to their specific needs.

## **✨ Features**


**1. Authentication System:**

- Built with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) to ensure secure and stateless authentication.

- Supports integration with third-party authentication providers like Auth0, enabling SSO (Single Sign-On) with platforms such as Google and Facebook.

- All protected routes require valid authentication tokens, ensuring only authorized access to sensitive data.

**1. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**

- Implements granular permissions based on roles (Admin, Moderator, User).

- Middleware validates user roles for actions such as profile updates, viewing user lists, or modifying data.
**3. Password Security:**

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt, adding a unique salt for each password to prevent brute-force and dictionary attacks.
- Secure password validation processes ensure no plaintext passwords are ever stored or transmitted.

**Data Security:**

- Input validation and sanitization to protect against SQL injection and XSS attacks.
- Encryption for sensitive data like passwords and tokens ensures security at rest and in transit.
